## Introduction

In this project, we are given a dataset with 79 features in which the end goal is to predict the sales price of various houses. All of the features and their descriptions can be found on the link <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data">here.</a> The main challenges with this dataset are: missing data, outliers and feature selection.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The first step to any data science project is to take a look at the data. Are their missing values in the data? Is the data clean or noisy? Are their outliers in the data? What is the distribution of our dataset? Answering these questions will give us a better idea of how to tackle this problem.
