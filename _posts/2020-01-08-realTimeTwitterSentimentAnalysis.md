## Inspiration
Twitter is a social media platform where everyone posts their opinion on certain topics. Using sentiment analysis we are able to get a general idea of how the overall population is feeling towards a brand, company, political leader or anything else. By monitoring this information, companies can make more informed decisions that would improve customer satisfaction.
