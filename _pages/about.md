I’m a data scientist with experience in manufacturing operations and a deep interest in machine learning for computer vision. I am currently involved in a computer vision related research project with the potential to revolutionize smartphone security.

I developed and deployed a point tracking algorithm as part of a data processing pipeline that successfully reduced our data labeling costs by 80%.

Currently, I am working on a data science project in which I scrape tweets, perform text analysis, and provide a dashboard that summarizes public opinion of trending topics.

My tech stack includes: Python, Machine Learning Libraries (NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, OpenCV), Web Application Frameworks (Dash, Flask), Data Visualization tools (Plotly, Seaborn), Heroku, Amazon Web Services (S3, EC2), Git, MySQL, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, API’s.
